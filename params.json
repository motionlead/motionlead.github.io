To do so click on Build Phases. In the Link Binary With Libraries section add the the following frameworks :\r\n- libz.dylib\r\n- libc++.dylib\r\n- AdSupport.framework\r\n- CoreMotion.framework\r\n- CoreTelephony.framework\r\n- OpenGLES.framework\r\n- QuartzCore.framework\r\n- StoreKit.framework\r\n- SystemConfiguration.framework\r\n- Security.framework\r\n\r\n> If your app need to be compatible with iOS versions prior to 6.0, set the AdSupport.framework as optional ([how?](http://motionlead.github.io/images/optional.gif)).\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Modify the Build Settings\r\n\r\nClick on Build Settings, select the All tab then search for Other Linker Flags. Double click on it and add the flag **-ObjC** ([how?](http://motionlead.github.io/images/otherlinkerflag.png)).\r\n\r\n> Make sure to write **-ObjC** and not **-Objc** or **-objc**, the case is important.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Build your app\r\n\r\nBuild your app to make sure that your project is configured properly.\r\n\r\n> If you are unable to build the app after adding the MotionLead SDK, contact us.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Integrating the SDK\r\n\r\nThe main object of the MotionLead iOS SDK is the MLView. This class is a subclass of UIView and allows you to display animated ads throughout your application.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n- Import the MotionLead framework\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n#import <MotionLead/MotionLead.h>\r\n```\r\n- Create a property holding the `MLView` instance and add the `MLViewDelegate` protocol\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n@interface ViewController : UIViewController <MLViewDelegate>\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic)   MLView  *adView;\r\n@end\r\n```\r\n- Initialize `self.adView` by replacing `PUBLISHER_KEY` with the key provided for your app and set the delegate.\r\n\r\n```objc\r\nself.adView = [[MLView alloc] initWithPublisherKey:@\"PUBLISHER_KEY\"];\r\nself.adView.delegate = self;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- To load an ad, call:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[self.adView loadAd];\r\n```\r\n> Once the ad is loaded, the SDK will call the delegate's **mlViewDidLoadAd:**.\r\n\r\n- To display an ad, call:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[self.adView displayAd];\r\n```\r\n\r\n> If no ad has been downloaded or an ad is already being displayed, the SDK will call the delegate's **mlviewDidFailToDisplayAd:withError:**\r\n\r\n#### Class methods\r\n\r\nAs long as the MLView is not displaying and ad, it will be deallocated when the object retaining it will be deallocated.\r\nWhen the MLView is displaying and ad, it will live on its own even if the object retaining it is deallocated.\r\n\r\nTo remove an MLView from the view hierarchy, call the class method:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MLView dismiss];\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the current MLView displaying an ad, call the class method:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n[MLView currentMLView];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThose two methods can be called anywhere in your app.\r\n\r\n#### MLView Delegate\r\n\r\nIn order to respond to changes in the state of the ad you should implement `MLViewDelegate` protocol methods.\r\n\r\n##### Examples\r\n\r\nTo display the ad right after it has been downloaded, write the following in your class:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)mlViewDidLoadAd:(MLView *)view {\r\n    [view displayAd];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo be notified that the application will be exited due to the user clicking on a call to action:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)mlViewWillLeaveApplication:(MLView *)view {\r\n  // Save data, pause game, etc\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Headers\r\n\r\nHeaders are fully documented, don't hesitate to take a look for an exhaustive list of methods and delegate call available in the SDK.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
